# rt_estimation
Rt estimation using local DSA

1. "rt_est_functions.R" contains 2 functions: 1 to simulate data given parameters and estimate Rt using DSA and Cori methods, and the other to plot the results against the true Rt value.
2. "data" folder contains all simulated data sets and results from the Rt estimation used in the manuscript (using rt_est function). Please note that rerunning this would take several hours.
3. "rt_plots_file.R" contains all the code necessary to plot results from results in the data folder.
